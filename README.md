### Individual work 3: Comparing 2 Linear Regression Systems on Random Data
---

In this project, I wanted to visually compare the holistic effectiveness of two data regressions. To do this I generated 5 random sets of data, each structured around a unique math equation, and then regressed a line of best fit for each. I then rescrambled the data, and drew another line of best fit 10 more times to create a sort of "visual average" for the regressed lines. My hope was to discover which method of regression was more accurate, which was more consistent, and which was most versatile.
